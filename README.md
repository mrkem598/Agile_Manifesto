# Agile Manifesto 
***
Equipped toward continuous improvement? The agile methodology can greatly increase your project’s prospects for success. Agile is a project management methodology that uses short development cycles called “sprints” to focus on continuous improvement in the development of a product or service.
Agile was first discussed in depth in the 1970s by William Royce who published a paper on the development of large software systems. Later in 2001, the Agile Manifesto, a "formal proclamation of four key values and 12 principles to guide an iterative and people-centric approach to software development," was published by 17 software developers and presented the first four in this page. 

Agile Manifesto that can bring clarity to what being agile truly means during any project development. I believe it's more than doing agile; it's about being agile in our behaviors and mindset. The principles don't talk about the specific individual requirements for it, but they are still significant for the team role. Here's my take on what each of these means to the team and requirements.

Number one, according to Angela (2017), our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. The teams facilitate the dialog that helps the product owner prioritize what the team builds. The teams understand what will delight users and satisfy customers. The teams support continuous delivery by facilitating the breaking down of functionality into small pieces of value. No one else provides this perspective. Business leaders see large chunks of functionality and the technical team focuses on technical components and functional layers. As we advocate for the users and customers by identifying small increments of value that users can see and experience. The teams define these increments so they can be prioritized, estimated, and worked on efficiently.

Next, number two: welcome changing requirements even late in development. I think this is the most common that will happen in data warehouse development. 

Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. Facilitate the team in discovering emerging thoughts and ideas that will make the product more valuable. External market changes and feedback from customers continuously influence and the team's help incorporates this feedback into the product backlog and priorities. Changing requirements are good. They mean the product is getting better than previously imagined.

The third principle, deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference to a shorter timescale. According to Agile Manifesto (no date), by using agile we are uncovering better ways of developing. teams are vital to helping customers, and business leaders realize the intended benefits of a product sooner. The teams slice works into small increments of value and help the team analyze business value, technical dependencies, and technical debt. It can be one thing to build great software and yet a different focus for the team to make it worthwhile from a customer perspective. Many times, discovering the value to customers means experimenting and learning from seeing users use and react to working software. 

<img width="100%" alt="Screen Shot 2019-03-13 at 8 54 43 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23619819/54360070-68b12c80-463a-11e9-87f4-f5cc0364ab81.png">

And the fourth principle: Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. The teams are engaged and available to the team daily. They facilitate continuous conversations throughout the day using high impact collaboration and communication that results in rapid learning and fast decision making. When this is done well, requirements and documentation are kept lightweight. The focus is on dialog rather than cranking up documents. They are the guiding practices that support teams in implementing and executing with agility.
